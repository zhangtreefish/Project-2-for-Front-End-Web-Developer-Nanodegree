1. In ResumeBuilder.js I built four JSONs, each one representing a different resume section. 

2. I then iterate through each JSON and append its information to index.html in the correct section, through the placeholder string in helper.js.
 
3. I added an interactive map by use of "append" of the googleMap string to `<div id=”mapDiv”>`.

4. I made sure that all of my codes for adding elements to the resume are within functions, and that all the functions are encapsulated within the same objects containing the related resume data.
