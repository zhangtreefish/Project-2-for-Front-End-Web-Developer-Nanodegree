1. In ResumeBuilder.js I built four JSONs, each one representing a different resume section. 

2. I then iterated through each JSON and "append"ed its information to index.html in the correct section, after "replace"ing the placeholder string in helper.js.
 
3. I added an interactive map by use of "append" of the googleMap string to `<div id=”mapDiv”>`.

4. I made sure that all of my codes for adding elements to the resume were within functions, and that all the functions were encapsulated within the respective objects, as required by Object-Oriented Programming.
